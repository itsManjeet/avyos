avyos is an experimental operating system distribution.
Things may be incomplete, unstable, or break unexpectedly.

You are currently in the Lipi shell.
This is a Lisp-style, expression-based shell —
it is NOT a Unix/POSIX-compatible shell.

Commands are evaluated as expressions, not programs.
Read the docs, explore carefully, and expect sharp edges.

Have fun hacking.\n\n")
