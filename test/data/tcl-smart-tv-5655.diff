-Warnings:
-
-Block 0, Base EDID:
-  Standard Timings: Standard Timing 1360x765 has a dubious odd vertical resolution.
-  Detailed Timing Descriptor #2: DTD is similar but not identical to DMT 0x51.
-Block 1, CTA-861 Extension Block:
-  Video Capability Data Block: Set Selectable YCbCr Quantization to avoid interop issues.
-  Add a Colorimetry Data Block with the sRGB colorimetry bit set to avoid interop issues.
-EDID:
-  Base EDID: Some timings are out of range of the Monitor Ranges:
-    Vertical Freq: 24.000 - 60.317 Hz (Monitor: 50.000 - 75.000 Hz)
-    Horizontal Freq: 15.625 - 75.000 kHz (Monitor: 30.000 - 80.000 kHz)

 Block 1, CTA-861 Extension Block:
   HDMI Audio Data Block: MS NonMixed support indicated but Max Stream Count == 0.
   Video Capability Data Block: Set Selectable RGB Quantization to avoid interop issues.
-EDID:
-  CTA-861: Native progressive timings are a mix of several resolutions.
